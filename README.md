# Millennium Payphone Support

This repository is for those who own one (or more!) of these truly unique payphones which Nortel developed in the 1990s.  If you grew up in Canada and some parts of the US during the 90s and early 2000s, you have most certainly used one of these payhones before.

As telephone companies began phasing these payphones out during the past decade, many of them appeared on online auction sites and even some estate sales.  As you may know, these payphones will not work unless you configure them with special programming.  In Canada, this was accomplished by programming the payphones with a special telephone number that connected it to Bell Canada's NCC (Network Control Centre) aka Millennium Manager.  Upon connection, the payphone downloaded its configuration tables and it was then available for service.

Being a telephone enthusiast who has worked in the telecom and IT industry for many years, I have always had an interest in telephones, from the old Western Electric 302 models that I used to restore to newer payphones such as the Millennium.  

Around 2012 I built an "at-home" version of the NCC server and was able to get my payphones working for my own enjoyment and sentimental reasons. At the time, no one really had an interest in this stuff so for me, it was just something fun that I can show guests at my house. 

With the ongoing decomissioning of payphones nowadays, there have been a number of new documents floating around the Internet and efforts by others to develop their own version of Millennium Manager.  I am glad that I share this interest with others!  It is also obvious that our telephone history/heritage will be preserved this way as well.

In any event, I am not going to go into the aspect of the back-end here.  The purpose of this repository is to help other telephone enthusiasts and collectors who own these payphones by providing documentation, firmware and other tools.

If you would like to contribute to this library, please get in touch with me.  As it is very new, it will probably take some time for it develop into something useful.

Kind regards,
Armen
