# Millennium Payphone Support

This repository is for those who own one (or more!) of the truly unique payphones which Nortel developed in the 1990s.  If you grew up in Canada and some parts of the US during the 90s and early 2000s, you have most certainly used one of these payhones before.

As telephone companies began phasing these payphones out during the past decade, many of these payphones appeared on online auction sites and even some estate sales.  Unfortunately, these payphones will not work unless you program them with special programming.  In Canada, this was accomplished by programming the payphones with a special telephone number that connected it to Bell Canada's NCC (Network Control Centre) Servers aka Millennium Manager.  Upon connection, the payphone downloaded its configuration and it was then available for service.

Being a telephone enthusiast who has worked in the telecom and IT industry for many years, I have always had an interest in telephones, from the old Western Electric 302 models to payphones like the Millennium.  

Around 2012 I built an "at-home" version of the NCC server and was able to get my payphones working for my own enjoyment. At the time, no one really had an interest in this stuff so it was just something fun I can show guests at my house. 

With the ongoing decomissioning of payphones nowadays, there have been a number of new documents floating around the Internet and efforts by others to develop their own version of Millennium Manager.  

In any event, I am not going to go into that aspect here and the purpose of this repository is really to help other telephone enthusiasts and collectors to restore or repair their Millennium payphones.

You will find a number of items here, namely firmware and documentation.  If you would like to contribute to this library, please get in touch with me.

Kind regards,
Armen
