# The Millennium Payphone

This repository is for those who own one (or more!) of these truly unique payphones which were developed by Northern Telecom (Nortel) in the 1990s.  If you grew up in Canada and some parts of the US during the 1990s and 2000s, you have most certainly used one of these payhones before.  They are still in use today, albeit in much smaller numbers.  As telephone companies began phasing some of these payphones out during the past decade, many of them have appeared on online auction sites and subsequently in people's homes.

I have always had an interest or fasincation with telephones (I don't know why) and that probably was one of the factors which lead me to work in the telecom industry for a while.  I have collected a variety of telephones from the old Western Electric 302 models that I used to restore, to payphones such as these.  However, unlike most other payphones, the Millennium payphones will (generally) not work unless you configure them.

**If you are curious about functionality or would like to learn more, I am currently putting together a Wiki which can be accessed by clicking [here](https://github.com/armeniki/Nortel-Millennium/wiki).**

Around 2012 I built an "at-home" version of the NCC server which I called "Millennium Manager Express":

I was then able to get my payphones to work for my own enjoyment and sentimental reasons.  It was also something fun that I can show guests when they came by! 

### Purpose of this Repo
I have realised that with the ongoing decomissioning of more payphones nowadays, there have been some people who also share an interest in these phones which is great!  

The purpose of this repository is to help other telephone enthusiasts and collectors who own these payphones by providing tips, documentation, firmware and other tools.
